      "If you only have 10 seconds...\n",
      "\n",
      "Twitter's new API will prevent you from running much of the code from _Mining the Social Web_, and this IPython Notebook shows you how to roll with the changes and adapt as painlessly as possible until an updated printing is available. In particular, it shows you how to authenticate before executing any API requests illustrated in this chapter. It is highly recommended that you read the IPython Notebook file for Chapter 1 before attempting the examples in this chapter if you haven't already.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you have a couple of minutes...\n",
      "\n",
      "Twitter is officially retiring v1.0 of their API as of March 2013 with v1.1 of the API being the new status quo. There are a few fundamental differences that social web miners that should consider (see Twitter's blog at https://dev.twitter.com/blog/changes-coming-to-twitter-api and https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1.1/overview) with the two changes that are most likely to affect an existing workflow being that authentication is now mandatory for *all* requests, rate-limiting being on a per resource basis (as opposed to an overall rate limit based on a fixed number of requests per unit time), various platform objects changing (for the better), and search semantics changing to a \"pageless\" approach. All in all, the v1.1 API looks much cleaner and more consistent, and it should be a good thing longer-term although it may cause interim pains for folks migrating to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The latest printing of Mining the Social Web (2012-02-22, Third release) reflects v1.0 of the API, and this document is intended to provide readers with updated examples from Chapter 4 of the book until a new printing provides updates.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unlike the IPython Notebook for Chapter 1, there is no filler in this notebook at this time. See the Chapter 1 notebook for a good introduction to using the Twitter API and all that it entails.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a reader of my book, I want you to know that I'm committed to helping you in any way that I can, so please reach out on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/MiningTheSocialWeb or on Twitter at http://twitter.com/SocialWebMining if you have any questions or concerns in the meanwhile. I'd also love your feedback on whether or not you think that IPython Notebook is a good tool for tinkering with the source code for the book, because I'm strongly considering it as a supplement for each chapter.\n",

      "## A Brief Technical Preamble\n",
      "\n",
      "* You will need to set your PYTHONPATH environment variable to point to the 'python_code' folder for the GitHub source code when launching this notebook or some of the examples won't work, because they import utility code that's located there\n",
      "\n",
      "* Note that this notebook doesn't repeatedly redefine a connection to the Twitter API. It creates a connection one time and resuses it throughout the remainder of the examples in the notebook\n",
      "\n",
      "* Arguments that are typically passed in through the command line are hardcoded in the examples for convenience. CLI arguments are typically in ALL_CAPS, so they're easy to spot and change as needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "* For simplicity, examples that harvest data are limited to small numbers so that it's easier to use experiment with this notebook (given that @timoreilly, the principal subject of the examples, has vast numbers of followers.)\n",
      "\n",
      "* The parenthetical file names at the end of the captions for the examples correspond to files in the 'python_code' folder of the GitHub repository\n",
      "\n",
      "* Just like you'd learn from reading the book, you'll need to have a Redis server running because several of the examples in this chapter store and fetch data from it."
