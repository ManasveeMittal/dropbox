# README

This directory contains an iPython Notebook (ipynb) that adapts sample code from Mining the Social Web. iPython is a terrific tool that is well worth a modest time investment to installed and start using if you haven't already started. iPython Notebook takes the iPython concept to the next level and introduces the concept of a browser-based notebook that allows you to craft a document and execute (most) Python source code inline. It's an amazing concept, is very useful for educational purposes, and if you give it a try, you'll likely get hooked. 

For convenience, there's also a raw Python dump of the notebook file in this directory as well.
