But who wants to be right all the time?\"\r \r This quote tugs on the thread that links all the fundamental struggles of being human, what it means to confront limits. \r \r I think of so many books or poems or individual lines that I've loved over the years that point to this theme:\r \r * Robert Browning's \"Ah, but a man's reach should exceed his grasp, Or what's a heaven for\" \r http://www.poetryfoundation.org/archive/poem.html?id=173001 \r \r * Rainer Maria Rilke's magnificent poem about Jacob wrestling with the angel, The Man Watching, which I've quoted in so many of my talks:\r \r http://www.poetry-chaikhana.com/R/RilkeRainerM/ManWatching.htm \r \r * Karl Jaspers' wonderful introduction to philosophy, Way to Wisdom, which starts with the idea that self knowledge becomes knowledge of our limits:\r \r http://www.amazon.com/Way-Wisdom-Introduction-Philosophy-Second/dp/0300097352/ \r \r Or even Edna St Vincent Millay's wonderful poem about death, Dirge without Music:\r \r http://www.cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/Poetry/Millay/Dirge_without_Music.html \r \r ...\r \r Down, down, down into the darkness of the grave\r Gently they go, the beautiful, the tender, the kind;\r Quietly they go, the intelligent, the witty, the brave.\r I know.

It might just say something important about overall cultural values. I quote:\r \r \"Mr. Sohm has touched on something. Caravaggiomania, as he calls it, implies not just that art history doctoral students may finally be struggling to think up anything fresh to say about Michelangelo. It suggests that the whole classical tradition in which Michelangelo was steeped is becoming ever more foreign and therefore seemingly less germane, even to many educated people. His otherworldly muscle men, casting the damned into hell or straining to emerge from thick blocks of veined marble, aspired to an abstract and bygone ideal of the sublime, grounded in Renaissance rhetoric, which, for postwar generations, now belongs with the poetry of Alexander Pope or plays by Corneille as admirable but culturally remote splendors.\r \r \"Caravaggio, on the other hand, exemplifies the modern antihero, a hyperrealist whose art is instantly accessible. His doe-eyed, tousle-haired boys with puffy lips and bubble buttocks look as if they\u2019ve just tumbled out of bed, not descended from heaven. Coarse not godly, locked into dark, ambiguous spaces by a strict geometry then picked out of deep shadow by an oracular light, his models come straight off the street. Cupid is clearly a hired urchin on whom Caravaggio strapped a pair of fake wings. The angel in his \u201cAnnunciation\u201d dangles like Chaplin\u2019s tramp on the high wire in \u201cThe Circus,\u201d from what must have been a rope contraption Caravaggio devised.\"\r \r It's a lovely article, and shows how a well crafted newspaper doesn't have to go to the lowest common denominator, but can inform, provoke, and educate. The Times is cultured in way that John Cowper Powys used the term in his book The Meaning of Culture ( http://bit.ly/cpGhOz - See my brief review here: http://tim.oreilly.com/articles/favebooks_0705.html )\r \r It's especially important that an article like this could make the front page, just like a sports story might.

Computer wavelet analysis has been used for attribution of the contributors in Perugino\u2019s Holy Family. An international group of computer and image scientists is studying the brushstrokes in paintings by van Gogh for detecting forgeries. Sophisticated computer analysis of perspective, shading, color and form has shed light on David Hockney\u2019s bold claim that as early as 1420, Renaissance artists employed optical devices such as concave mirrors to project images onto their canvases.\r \r How do these computer methods work? What can computers reveal about images that even the best-trained connoisseurs, art historians and artist cannot? How much more powerful and revealing will these methods become? In short, how is computer image analysis changing our understanding of art?\r \r This profusely illustrate lecture for non-scientists will include works by Jackson Pollock, Vincent van Gogh, Jan van Eyck, Hans Memling, Lorenzo Lotto, and others.

Huge ecosystem.\"\r \r And I believe I pointed out that a lot of those developer ecosystems were in markets where a lot of money is still being made, and said that it was important not just to pay attention to the hip, cool markets as if they were the only ones that mattered.\r \r Ashlee also wrote:\r \r \"Mr. O\u2019Reilly traces part of the problem back to the company\u2019s developers. Microsoft spends a great deal of time and money shepherding a vast network of partner companies and people that base their livelihoods on improving and supporting Microsoft\u2019s products.\r \r \"These software developers and technicians have bet their careers on Microsoft and largely benefited from that choice. In addition, they have helped keep Microsoft relevant during the various ups and downs in the technology market.\"\r \r I don't remember saying anything of the kind. It may be true, but I am not the source. Nor was I the source for these paragraphs:\r \r \"But the recent crops of computer science graduates and start-ups have tended to move far afield from Microsoft, Mr. O\u2019Reilly said.\r \r \"The vast majority of technology start-ups today rely on open-source software, distributed by Microsoft competitors, for the core parts of their technology infrastructure.\r \r And so the technology-minded people coming out of college have started learning their craft on free software and betting their careers on non-Microsoft wares.\"\r \r The only comment from myself that I recognized at all was this one:\r \r \"Mr. O\u2019Reilly said the quick cancellation of the Kin may demonstrate that Microsoft has finally seen the depth of its woes when it comes to attracting consumers and younger audiences.\r \r \u201cThis should be seen as a success for them,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Reilly said. \u201cThey grew fat and happy, but are now waking up to their different competitive position.\u201d\r \r I made a comparison to when Steve Jobs came back to Apple, and slashed existing products. Learning what is not working and responding quickly is a sign that a company is getting its mojo back.\r \r There is certainly some truth to the assertions in the story.

A few comments have touched on this sentiment, most notably Bob Glickstein.

Unfortunately our societies & cultures often put attaining great wealth, power and status as the ultimate goals to be achieved in life. It's true that a legacy can be built on each of those things, but it's what you do with your wealth, power and status that will truly establish your legacy as one that is of great benefit to humanity, over one that is only about your own aggrandizement. Another fact of life in our world currently that people must realize is that it's built up in such a way as to incentivize and reward sociopaths and psychopaths to seek wealth, power, status and leadership positions. People with these kinds of personality types are incapable of feeling shame, feeling emotions for other living beings, are very selfish and mindful about their peers perception of their persona above all else.

(I also disagree with the relative impact Facebook has had versus IBM, but perhaps I am biased as I don't use Facebook.) So it seems there are actually at least two things to measure. How much innovation is occurring, and how well that innovation is being deployed or reaching \"the market\". I realize these are not necessarily completely independent things. Patents are, at best, an indirect measure of how much innovation is occurring, but are very likely misleading for the reasons you state. But patents are also, unfortunately, easy to measure. You just ask the patent office how many patents did they approve any given year. So number of patents are what we use. It's similar to the reason why the stock market is used as a proxy for the health of the economy in general. It's easy to measure the stock market, and everybody is enthralled by the numbers that go up and down (and they get to endlessly argue about their meaning)... To be more inclusive of innovations occurring outside the patent system, at the moment it seems you would have to take a survey somehow. The web makes an obvious choice. You could try to identify innovation sources (I'm deliberately not defining innovation right at the moment) and then try to count their innovations for the year. Finding newly registered domains is probably easy, determining which domains are hosting websites for innovative individuals, projects, and companies and counting their innovations is likely a lot harder. To get rid of the work of taking a survey, you could create a http://freshmeat.net for innovations. Individuals and companies big and small could post notices to a service provider of their choice indicating their latest developments. (Or possibly some sort of Atom feed perhaps combined with pubsubhubbub etc... Something that can be crawled by search engines.) That way the innovators and innovations count themselves. (One other thought for going through existing channels for counting innovation, does anybody bother to ask the copyright office about the number of registered copyrights for software? I'm not saying that's a better choice. I'm just wondering if people look to the copyright office as a way to measure technical innovations.)

Here's why: I receive several emails each month announcing that key components, like the data store are either completely down or not writeable. To be fair, many of these outages are planned maintenance, and they usually give 24-48 hour notice. With each email, I breathe a little sigh of relief that I stuck with EC2 so far.

Once you customize your data models for Big Table, the rest is a snap since Django is supported automatically. In the end, GAE was a blessing for creating a dynamically scalable web app. It would have been much more difficult to accomplish this on AWS. AWS was useful, however, for serving the back end of our infrastructure. Since AWS allows you to run any code you want, we were able to create a highly tuned data processing infrastructure. In contrast to GAE, you can create relational databases on AWS. Furthermore, on GAE there is a time limit on every function you execute, so it is terrible for data-intensive operations. With AWS you can use as much time and CPU as you'd like. We couldn't have created our data processing infrastructure on GAE. But on AWS, it was a pleasure.

It sounds like you have a developer mindset, so I'll assume you're looking for more. I would lump VMware + Springsource in with this.

As much as people like to claim otherwise, Google completely owns search and has one of the best email services. The problem is that Google tends to keep a lot of the good stuff to itself. For example, people like to ask why third-party Gmail clients all suck in that none of them offer label or threading support like the web app or the Android client. The reason is that Google hasn't released a public Gmail API and prohibits people from scraping that information from their accounts, on threat of having that account closed without warning. Sound like any other company? Apple is right to depend on Google as little as possible, at least in areas where Google completely owns the experience and the technology. Why do you think that you can only get the Google Experience apps on Google-approved handsets? Or why Google only approves phones? These apps are as closed, locked and proprietary as any of the Apple iPhone apps. That's why I have to disagree with people like @Gregory who believe that Apple views the open web as a threat. The open web is open to everyone and all platforms. That means that there isn't any lockout, which is more important to Apple than lock-in. Lockout is the problem that Apple had to deal with for years with Microsoft, and I'm sure that they aren't looking forward to duplicating that experience with Google. That's why Apple keeps pushing WebKit forward and why its open-source for everyone who wants it, Google, Palm, RIM and MSFT included. An open, standards-based web that isn't controlled by any single company is an advantage to Apple. Hell, playing with iPad's Safari in the developer simulator convinced me that I need to buy an iPad. The browsing experience is just that good. Also, don't forget that Apple tried to get everyone to develop WebKit-optimised webapps before they released Cocoa Touch, and guess what? That experience birthed the modern mobile-optimised web.", "name": "Paul Ward"}, {"content": "@ Paul Ward Quick correction: Gmail has long supported both POP and IMAP, and supported email forwarding, for free [1,2,3].

Before I get too long-winded, let me just poin out that my gripe is not with data portability, which Google handles better than most. Its also not about Google offering useful services (I've been a Gmail user since it was invite only, evangelize all the time, and recognize that GCal is superior in a lot of ways to MobileMe's calendar, especially WRT sharing). My problem is that despite lots of talk about openness and transparency, Google keeps the things that really differentiate Gmail to itself. Gmail, the email client is open in that it allows you to easily get your mail, but Gmail the service is alarmingy closed.

Claire says: \u201cDelicious warm or chilled! Serve with applesauce and low-fat plain yogurt, if desired. Kids will love watching this simple vegetable turn into something new and delicious!\u201d\r \r 1 large cauliflower\r 6 eggs or egg substitute\r 1/4 cup chopped Italian parsley (we use fresh marjoram instead - gives amazing flavor)\r 1/2 small onion, minced\r 1/4 cup white flour (we used spelt flour)\r 1/2 teaspoon baking powder\r 2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese (we leave this out)\r Salt and pepper, to taste\r 2 to 3 tablespoons olive oil\r \r Remove leaves and core from cauliflower. Steam the head of cauliflower until soft-tender when pierced with a fork. Drain in a colander. Set aside until cool enough to handle. Place the florets in a large bowl. Mash lightly with a potato masher, until the cauliflower is broken into tiny pieces. Add the eggs, parsley or marjoram, onion, flour, baking powder, cheese, and salt and pepper to taste. Mix together, beating lightly to combine.\r \r Heat a nonstick griddle over low heat. Brush the skillet with about 1 teaspoon of the olive oil. Scoop \u00bc cup of batter into the skillet for each pancake, and flatten slightly. Cook the pancakes for 4 minutes without disturbing then carefully lift up the edge with a plastic spatula to check them. When the underside is a medium brown color, turn carefully, using two spatulas. Cook the other side for 4 to 5 minutes until nicely browned. Carefully transfer the pancakes to a platter. Stir the batter between cooking batches of the pancakes, repeating the process until all of the batter is used.\r \r From \u201cClaire\u2019s Classic American Vegetarian Cooking,\u201d Claire Criscuolo, Penguin Books, New York, NY, 1997.\r \r Onion Jam:\r \r 2 T olive oil\r 2 T butter\r 4 cups coarsely chopped onion\r 1/2 t salt\r 1/4 to 1/2 cup agave syrup or maple syrup (original recipe calls for 1/4 cup sugar, 1/4 cup brown sugar)\r 1/2 cup red wine vinegar\r 1/2 t caraway\r \r Saute onion till tender, add sweetener and vinegar et al, saute another half hour or so till reduced and jammy.

If the internet model, in which any device, application, or service can be brought to market without restriction or approval by the network provider, does not take hold in the wireless ecosystem, the growth of internet information providers like Google will eventually grind to a halt.\" Google competing with Apple via Android won't kill Apple - at most, it will take away some of what is already huge upside. But Google failing to succeed with Android literally could be an eventual death-knell for Google. I understand that Steve Jobs feels betrayed - after all, Eric Schmidt was on his board. But I think he's being short-sighted. He's making his phone less competitive by excluding Google products like Voice and turn-by-turn directions. That being said, competition is good for the industry, and Apple's rumored embrace of Microsoft will boost the competition between Microsoft and Google and keep things very interesting. It's still sad that two great and innovative companies are at odds. And even sadder that Apple is letting spite trump business judgment, and closing their phone even further from the open web. In the end, if the iPhone fails, it will be because closed systems have weaker adoption dynamics than open systems, not because Eric Schmidt betrayed Apple.", "link": "http://www.google.com/buzz/107033731246200681024/MuerW5Z8Lxg", "comments": [{"content": "_\"Google competing with Apple via Android won't kill Apple - at most, it will take away some of what is already huge upside.

Let's have a look at Google's recent actions - they've created a mobile phone operating system, taking on all the incumbents, which they've released for free.

SImilarly all of Google's free productivity apps are an assault on Microsoft's future. And then you have the browser, which is aiming to take share from Microsoft, but will also take on Firefox and Mozilla directly, while putting their funding in doubt. It's no wonder that the major technology companies feel nervous. Google somehow have moved from this geek-founded, good of the world company into turning all of their huge money from search into a systematic attack on every last one of the major players in the industry - taking the bottom out of all of their markets by releasing stuff essentially for free. While you could argue that this is about survival, or about making the web better, the other way to look at it is that it's an incredibly aggressive anti-competitive move, along the lines of Microsoft installing IE on every computer, only not on one front, but on all of them. You say that competition is good for the industry, and I would agree - that's precisely why I find Google's more recent moves a bit troubling. Doing this in one or two areas would be one thing, but OS's, productivity apps, mobile phones, mobile phone OS's and browsers on top of your core business of search and search advertising? I mean, that's half the industry destabilised in the course of a year... Google are not that far away from giving away phones to lock people into to using their search on mobile devices.

I guess my worry is, as ever, what happens when an industry is overly reliant on one player that dominates multiple markets. We were all nervous about Microsoft's role, but that's been whittled away a bit.

I know that the NYT had a better headline on its hands by making the competition (of which there is some, and competition is good), sound like an epic personal struggle between the Titans and the Gods (Cronus vs Zeus or something), but reality is never quite that black and white. Google still writes software for the iPhone, Apple and Google are still working together on webkit very amicably, and my guess is that Apple engineers still use google.com , google code, gmail, etc., without feeling the slightest bit conflicted about it. All that said, I'm personally a little worried about a future with locked-down app platforms, and Terms of the iTunes App Store is downright terrifying when you think of it from a software freedom perspective.

If you follow the IT industry since that time (or had time to research the IT industry history), you can see that Mr. Jobs did the same with the Macintosh computer. A closed architecture machine with just a few expansion options. I believe that if the Macintosh was release this century (with the internet) we will have the same on it (central App Store, signed apps, etc...) and no Open Source at all on it. While at that time (1984), the world was open (IBM PC and Apple II were all user expandable computers), that's not hard to find out why it failed on broad acceptance. Now Mr. Jobs is doing it again with the iPhone / iPod Touch and the iPad. His ideas could be expanded a little more to have broader acceptance (like AppStore franchising, something like any provider could set an AppStore and sell applications, centering the revenue on Apple or not. The point is that there should be no tight control on application acceptance and the model could be decentralized. The user should have control over this, as he is the one who knows what is needed. I'm an independent developer and a University IT teacher. I'd like to have my own apps running on my iPhone (if I owned one) and distribute it through my students without all the bureaucracy of having it accepted by Apple. Apple benefit itself a lot with Open Source projects to get a Mac OS X / iPhone OS stable core, and now it just make life harder for all independent / Open Source developers. I'm a Mac user and I love Apple machines and the Mac OS X, but we can't just pretend that Apple didn't do that. I didn't buy an iPhone yet, because it's quite expensive here (I live in Brazil), and also because I'll have to jailbreak it to use SSH clients and a Terminal (vt100) software on it. I'm not going against Apple, neither favoring Google. I just want to let you know my opinions about this.If Google is getting successful on Android, it's basically because they are delivering what the customer wants.

As much as people like to claim otherwise, Google completely owns search and has one of the best email services. The problem is that Google tends to keep a lot of the good stuff to itself. For example, people like to ask why third-party Gmail clients all suck in that none of them offer label or threading support like the web app or the Android client. The reason is that Google hasn't released a public Gmail API and prohibits people from scraping that information from their accounts, on threat of having that account closed without warning. Sound like any other company? Apple is right to depend on Google as little as possible, at least in areas where Google completely owns the experience and the technology. Why do you think that you can only get the Google Experience apps on Google-approved handsets? Or why Google only approves phones? These apps are as closed, locked and proprietary as any of the Apple iPhone apps. That's why I have to disagree with people like @Gregory who believe that Apple views the open web as a threat. The open web is open to everyone and all platforms. That means that there isn't any lockout, which is more important to Apple than lock-in. Lockout is the problem that Apple had to deal with for years with Microsoft, and I'm sure that they aren't looking forward to duplicating that experience with Google. That's why Apple keeps pushing WebKit forward and why its open-source for everyone who wants it, Google, Palm, RIM and MSFT included. An open, standards-based web that isn't controlled by any single company is an advantage to Apple. Hell, playing with iPad's Safari in the developer simulator convinced me that I need to buy an iPad.

In the end, GAE was a blessing for creating a dynamically scalable web app. It would have been much more difficult to accomplish this on AWS. AWS was useful, however, for serving the back end of our infrastructure. Since AWS allows you to run any code you want, we were able to create a highly tuned data processing infrastructure. In contrast to GAE, you can create relational databases on AWS. Furthermore, on GAE there is a time limit on every function you execute, so it is terrible for data-intensive operations. With AWS you can use as much time and CPU as you'd like. We couldn't have created our data processing infrastructure on GAE. But on AWS, it was a pleasure.

Just one (probably minor) data point; from this software engineer's perspective, it doesn't feel personal at all.

I know that the NYT had a better headline on its hands by making the competition (of which there is some, and competition is good), sound like an epic personal struggle between the Titans and the Gods (Cronus vs Zeus or something), but reality is never quite that black and white. Google still writes software for the iPhone, Apple and Google are still working together on webkit very amicably, and my guess is that Apple engineers still use google.com , google code, gmail, etc., without feeling the slightest bit conflicted about it. All that said, I'm personally a little worried about a future with locked-down app platforms, and Terms of the iTunes App Store is downright terrifying when you think of it from a software freedom perspective. But to me that means, as Tim suggests, the world should just double down on HTML5 and open platforms like Android (or Windows Mobile, if you can believe it), and let healthy competition do its thing.

If you follow the IT industry since that time (or had time to research the IT industry history), you can see that Mr. Jobs did the same with the Macintosh computer. A closed architecture machine with just a few expansion options. I believe that if the Macintosh was release this century (with the internet) we will have the same on it (central App Store, signed apps, etc...) and no Open Source at all on it. While at that time (1984), the world was open (IBM PC and Apple II were all user expandable computers), that's not hard to find out why it failed on broad acceptance. Now Mr. Jobs is doing it again with the iPhone / iPod Touch and the iPad. His ideas could be expanded a little more to have broader acceptance (like AppStore franchising, something like any provider could set an AppStore and sell applications, centering the revenue on Apple or not. The point is that there should be no tight control on application acceptance and the model could be decentralized. The user should have control over this, as he is the one who knows what is needed. I'm an independent developer and a University IT teacher. I'd like to have my own apps running on my iPhone (if I owned one) and distribute it through my students without all the bureaucracy of having it accepted by Apple. Apple benefit itself a lot with Open Source projects to get a Mac OS X / iPhone OS stable core, and now it just make life harder for all independent / Open Source developers. I'm a Mac user and I love Apple machines and the Mac OS X, but we can't just pretend that Apple didn't do that. I didn't buy an iPhone yet, because it's quite expensive here (I live in Brazil), and also because I'll have to jailbreak it to use SSH clients and a Terminal (vt100) software on it. I'm not going against Apple, neither favoring Google. I just want to let you know my opinions about this.If Google is getting successful on Android, it's basically because they are delivering what the customer wants.

As much as people like to claim otherwise, Google completely owns search and has one of the best email services. The problem is that Google tends to keep a lot of the good stuff to itself. For example, people like to ask why third-party Gmail clients all suck in that none of them offer label or threading support like the web app or the Android client. The reason is that Google hasn't released a public Gmail API and prohibits people from scraping that information from their accounts, on threat of having that account closed without warning. Sound like any other company? Apple is right to depend on Google as little as possible, at least in areas where Google completely owns the experience and the technology. Why do you think that you can only get the Google Experience apps on Google-approved handsets? Or why Google only approves phones? These apps are as closed, locked and proprietary as any of the Apple iPhone apps. That's why I have to disagree with people like @Gregory who believe that Apple views the open web as a threat. The open web is open to everyone and all platforms. That means that there isn't any lockout, which is more important to Apple than lock-in. Lockout is the problem that Apple had to deal with for years with Microsoft, and I'm sure that they aren't looking forward to duplicating that experience with Google. That's why Apple keeps pushing WebKit forward and why its open-source for everyone who wants it, Google, Palm, RIM and MSFT included. An open, standards-based web that isn't controlled by any single company is an advantage to Apple. Hell, playing with iPad's Safari in the developer simulator convinced me that I need to buy an iPad. The browsing experience is just that good. Also, don't forget that Apple tried to get everyone to develop WebKit-optimised webapps before they released Cocoa Touch, and guess what?

Claire says: \u201cDelicious warm or chilled! Serve with applesauce and low-fat plain yogurt, if desired. Kids will love watching this simple vegetable turn into something new and delicious!\u201d\r \r 1 large cauliflower\r 6 eggs or egg substitute\r 1/4 cup chopped Italian parsley (we use fresh marjoram instead - gives amazing flavor)\r 1/2 small onion, minced\r 1/4 cup white flour (we used spelt flour)\r 1/2 teaspoon baking powder\r 2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese (we leave this out)\r Salt and pepper, to taste\r 2 to 3 tablespoons olive oil\r \r Remove leaves and core from cauliflower. Steam the head of cauliflower until soft-tender when pierced with a fork. Drain in a colander. Set aside until cool enough to handle. Place the florets in a large bowl. Mash lightly with a potato masher, until the cauliflower is broken into tiny pieces. Add the eggs, parsley or marjoram, onion, flour, baking powder, cheese, and salt and pepper to taste. Mix together, beating lightly to combine.\r \r Heat a nonstick griddle over low heat. Brush the skillet with about 1 teaspoon of the olive oil. Scoop \u00bc cup of batter into the skillet for each pancake, and flatten slightly. Cook the pancakes for 4 minutes without disturbing then carefully lift up the edge with a plastic spatula to check them. When the underside is a medium brown color, turn carefully, using two spatulas. Cook the other side for 4 to 5 minutes until nicely browned. Carefully transfer the pancakes to a platter. Stir the batter between cooking batches of the pancakes, repeating the process until all of the batter is used.\r \r From \u201cClaire\u2019s Classic American Vegetarian Cooking,\u201d Claire Criscuolo, Penguin Books, New York, NY, 1997.\r \r Onion Jam:\r \r 2 T olive oil\r 2 T butter\r 4 cups coarsely chopped onion\r 1/2 t salt\r 1/4 to 1/2 cup agave syrup or maple syrup (original recipe calls for 1/4 cup sugar, 1/4 cup brown sugar)\r 1/2 cup red wine vinegar\r 1/2 t caraway\r \r Saute onion till tender, add sweetener and vinegar et al, saute another half hour or so till reduced and jammy. Serve on pancakes with applesauce, sour cream, et al.\r \r P.S. I have an AGA stove, so I just put this in the oven after a bit of initial sauteing. You can probably do the same, with a medium oven.", "link": "http://www.google.com/buzz/107033731246200681024/h1tciv2psSP", "comments": [{"content": "is it made with Cauliflower? wow.
