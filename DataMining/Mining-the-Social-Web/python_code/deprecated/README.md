# Overview

Google Buzz no longer exists, so all ../buzz__.py scripts have 
been moved to this directory and replaced with essentially identical
../plus__*.py scripts to align with Chapter 7 of Mining the Social Web
shifting from Google Buzz to Google+ as a domain.

If you have an older copy of Mining the Social Web in which Chapter 7
reflects Google Buzz, you can still use the buzz__*.py scripts against
an archive of Tim O'Reilly's Google Buzz data that's located in ../../data
and was produced from buzz__get_buzz_posts_and_comments.py (Example 7-1 of
Mining the Social Web), because this script is no longer functional. All
other examples in Chapter 7 besides Example 7-1 should work just fine, and 
still provide a fine way to learn about the "TF-IDF, Cosine Similarity, and 
Collocations" material in the chapter.

Whether you have a newer copies of Mining the Social Web, which reflects the Google+ edits
to Chapter 7, or have an older copy that still reflects Google Buzz, you are invited
to try out ../plus__get_activities.py to collect Google+ data for users and run the analysis
scripts. You'll have a lot of fun in either case.
