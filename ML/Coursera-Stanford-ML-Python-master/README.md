Assignments for Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course implemented in Python without solutions in line with the [Coursera Code of Honor](https://www.coursera.org/about/terms/honorcode "Coursera Honor Code"). The code is structurally equivalent to the Matlab implementation from Coursera and the results are numerically equivalent with the correct Python implementation of the incomplete scripts. After completing each assignment, students can submit for grading to the Coursera website by executing the submit.py script. e.g below: (OSX or Linux) (On Windows change "export PYTHONPATH=../" to "set PYTHONPATH=..\")

```
cd Coursera-Stanford-ML-Python/ex1
export PYTHONPATH=../
python submit.py
