we simplify things by specifying a set of hypotheses that are
Mutually exclusive: At most one hypothesis in the set can be true, and
Collectively exhaustive: There are no other possibilities; at least one of the
hypotheses has to be true.
I use the word suite for a set of hypotheses that has these properties

The diachronic interpretation
There is another way to think of Bayes’s theorem: it gives us a way to update
the probability of a hypothesis, H, in light of some body of data, D.

This way of thinking about Bayes’s theorem is called the diachronic inter-
pretation. “Diachronic” means that something is happening over time; in
this case the probability of the hypotheses changes, over time, as we see
new data.

Rewriting Bayes’s theorem with H and D yields:
p ( H | D ) =[p ( H ) p ( D | H )]/[p ( D )]


In this interpretation, each term has a name:
H: Hypotheis
D: Data
• p ( H ) is the probability of the hypothesis before we see the data, called
the prior probability, or just prior.
• p ( H | D ) is what we want to compute, the probability of the hypothesis
after we see the data, called the posterior.
• p ( D | H ) is the probability of the data under the hypothesis, called the
likelihood.
• p ( D ) is the probability of the data under any hypothesis, called the
normalizing constant.
