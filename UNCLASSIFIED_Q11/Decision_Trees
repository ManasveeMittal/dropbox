Decision Trees (DTs) 
	non-parametric supervised learning method
	used for classification and regression
	The goal is to create a model that predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features.
	PICture: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/tree/plot_tree_regression.html
	approximate a sine curve with a set of if-then-else decision rules
	The deeper the tree, the more complex the decision rules and the fitter the model.
	cost of predicting data
		log(num_obs)
	Data type:
		numerical
		categorical
	multi-output problems
		True
	WHITE box model
	minor deviation from assumptions
		still perform well
	DISADVANTAGES(and how to avoid)
		overfitting
			set minimum number of samples required at a leaf node 
			set the maximum depth of the tree
		unstable on small variations in the data
			using decision trees within an ensemble

		sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier :http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier.html#sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier
		inputs 
			an array X, sparse or dense, of size [n_samples, n_features] holding the training samples
			array Y of integer values, size [n_samples], holding the class labels for the training samples
