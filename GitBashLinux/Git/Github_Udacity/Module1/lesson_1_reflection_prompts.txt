What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros:
    	Only relevant changes are saved
    	Less no. of versions
    Cons:
    	Reuire manual labour
    	Need to be puctuual and systematic rregarding commits

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
