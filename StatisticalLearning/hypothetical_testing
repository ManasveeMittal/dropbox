The standard approach to carrying out a statistical test involves the following steps:
● specify the hypothesis to be tested
● select a suitable statistical model
● design and carry out an experiment/study
● calculate a test statistic
● calculate the probability value
● determine the conclusion of the test.

hypothesis is a statement about the value of an
unknown parameter in the model

H0, null : "status quo” hypothesis
H1 :alternative hypothesis,  

Focus of test: “Do the data provide sufficient
evidence to justify our rejecting H0 ?”

One-sided and two-sided tests


One_sided
H 0 : smoking makes no difference to life expectancy| l(smoking)=l0
H 1 : smoking reduces life expectancy	| l(smoking)< lo

Two-sided
H 0 : smoking makes no difference to life expectancy | l(smoking)=l0
H 1 : smoking affects life expectancy|  l(smoking) != lo


Test statistics

Def:P-value i.e standardized value calculated from sample data
		degree of agreement between smaple of data and null hypothesis
		

Errors:
	type I error: rejecting H0 when it is in fact true
		P(type I) = α = “size” of the test
	type II error: accepting H0 when it is false
		P(type II) = β |power of a test = 1-β


Q-Probabilities of testing error
	PF(X) ~ Exp(λ)
	H0 : λ=1/20
	H1 : λ=1/30

Testing criteria: X<28 => accepted, else rejected.
	P(Type1) = P(X>28| λ=1/20)
	P(Type2) = P(X<28| λ=1/30)

Neyman-Pearson test: 
	For given α,find such a test for which the other error probability, β , is as small as possible for every value of the parameter specified by the alternative hypothesis

Q-1> TEST STATISTIC VS SIZE OF TEST
eg alpha = 0.1, p-value =0.07 => reject H0
	 alpha = 0.05, p-value= 0.07 => accept(do not reject) H0

TESTING MEAN WHEN POPULATION VARIANCE IS UNKNOWN, USE t-test:
(sample mean- population mean)  /  (sqrt(sample variance) / sqrt(n)) ~ t (n-1)
TESTING MEAN WHEN POPULATION VARIANCE IS KNOWN, USE z-test:
z = (sample mean- population mean)  /  (sqrt(sample variance) / sqrt(n)) ~ N(0,1)
TESTING POPULATION VARIANCE, use Chi-square test:
(n-1)*(sample variance)/(population variance) ~ Chi-square(n-1)



Critical values:
	Z i.e standard normal distribution
		tail area	two-sided 	one-sided
		0.1						1.28
		0.05					1.645
		0.025		            1.96
		0.01					2.33
		0.005					2.58

	t i.e students t distribution

Q-2	 
sum(Xi) =120
Sum(Square(Xi)) = 1693.33
size of test = 5%
sum(i)=10

i> Var(X) = unknown
H0 := u=15
H1 := u<>15
t = -1.792 > -2.262 (t(9) critical value)
Hence, HO is not rejected.

ii> Var(X) = 15
H0 := u=15
H1 := u<>15

z = -2.108 < -1.96 (=z at 5% two sided)
	OR 
P(Z<z) = 0.0175 <(0.05/2) 
Hence HO is rejected

iii> H0 : Var(X) = 20
	 H1 : Var(X) <>20
c = 12.45,
two sided critical values = 2.7 and 19.02
Hence, H0 can't be rejected.

CONTINUITY CORRECTION:
	We need to provide for continiuty when we estimate discrete distribution using continuous distribution:
		x >  13 	<=>		 x > 13.5
		x >= 13 	<=>		 x > 12.5
		x <  13 	<=>		 x < 12.5
		x <= 13 	<=>		 x < 13.5

		x <  -9		<=>		 x <-9.5
		x <= -9		<=>		 x <-8.5
		x >  -9		<=> 	 x > -8.5
		x >= -9		<=>  	 x > -9.5

TESTING DIFFERENCE BETWEEN POPULATION MEANS

H0: u1  = u2
H1: u1 <> u2

Let u1 = population mean of A
	u2 = population mean of B
	U1 = sample mean of A
	U2 = sample mean of B
	nA = no. of sample observations of A
	nB = no. of sample observations of B
	S1 = Sample variance of population A
	S2 = Sample variance of population B
	square(Sp) = pooled variance of A and B

square(Sp) = ((nA -1)*S1 + (nB - 1)*S2) / (nA + nB -2))

test_statistic =( (u1 -u2) - (U1 - U2) / Sp*( sqrt(1/nA + 1/nB)) )
 
test_statistic ~ t(nA + nB -2)


F-test

precision or positive predictive value (PPV)=TP/(TP+FP) = true positive/predicted positives 
recall or sensitivity= TP/(TP+FN) = true positives/actual positives
specificity = TN/(TN+FP)
F1 score= HarmonicMean(precison,recall)
