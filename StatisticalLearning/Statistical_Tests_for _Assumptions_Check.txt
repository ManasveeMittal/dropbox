	Assumption: Equality of Variances
		Levene's Test for Equality of Variances

			Python:
				Hlink:https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.14.0/reference/generated/scipy.stats.levene.html
				scipy.stats.levene(*args, **kwds)
				Parameters:
					sample1, sample2, ... : array_like
				Returns:
					W:the test statistic
					p-value
			fail to reject the null hypothesis when
				at the 0.05 significance level when the value of the Levene test statistic is less than the critical value OR
				If the significance (p value) of Levene's test is greater than 5% level of significance (.05)

			W= {(N-k)/(k-1)}*{SUM_overI(Ni*(mean(Zi)-mean(Z)))/SUM_overI_overJ(mean(Zij)-mean(Zi))}
				variable Y 
				sample of size N
				divided into k subgroups,
				Ni is the sample size of the ith subgroup
				mean(Yi) : mean/median/trimmed mean of ith subgroup
				Zij = absolute(Yij - mean(Yij))
				mean(Zi): group mean of Zij by i


			Technically speaking, The Levene test rejects the hypothesis that the variances are equal if W > F(α, k-1, N-k) where F(α, k-1, N-k) is the upper critical value of the F distribution with k-1 and N-k degrees of freedom at a significance level of α.
