    "1 | 1 | 1\n",
    "0 | 0 | 1\n",
    "1 | 0 | 0\n",
    "\n",
    "When we add more models to our ensemble, we just add more columns to the combined predictions. Ultimately, we don't want this matrix, though -- we want one prediction per row in the training data. To do this, we'll need to create rules to turn each row of our matrix of predictions into a single number.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to create a Final Prediction vector:\n",

    "1  |     0   |   0  |    0\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways to get from the output of multiple models to a final vector of predictions. One method is **majority voting**, where each classifier gets a \"vote\", and the most commonly voted value for each row wins. This only works if there are more than 2 classifiers (and ideally an odd number so we don't have to write a rule to break ties). Majority voting is what we applied in the example above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since in the last screen we only had two classifiers, we'll have to use a different method to combine predictions. We'll take the mean of all the items in a row. Right now, we're using the predict method, which returns either 0 or 1. predict returns something like this:\n",

Since 0 and 1 are our two classes, we'll get a matrix with as many rows as the income dataframe and 2 columns. predict_proba will return something like this:\n",

    "If we just take the second column, we get the average value that the classifier would predict for that row. If there's a .9 probability that the correct classification is 1, we can use the .9 as the value the classifier is predicting. This will give us a continuous output in a single vector instead of just 0 or 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can then add all of the vectors we get through this method together and divide by the number of vectors to get the mean prediction by all the members of the ensemble. We can then round off to get 0 or 1 predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we use the predict_proba method on both classifiers from the last screen to generate probabilities, take the mean for each row, and then round the results, we'll get ensemble predictions."

    "\n",
    "If you give both of them a project, since they both have different knowledge and experience, they'll both approach it in slightly different ways. They may both produce code that achieves the same result, but one may run faster in certain areas. The other may have a better interface. Even though both of them have about the same talent level, because they approach the problem differently, their solutions are stronger in different areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we combine the best parts of both of their projects, we'll end up with a stronger combined project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensembling is the exact same. Both models are approaching the problem slightly differently, and building a different tree because we used different parameters for each. Each tree makes different predictions in different areas. Even though both trees have about the same accuracy, when we combine them, the result is stronger because it leverages the strengths of both approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "The more \"diverse\", or dissimilar, the models used to construct an ensemble, the stronger the combined predictions will be (assuming that all models have about the same accuracy). Ensembling a decision tree and a logistic regression model, which use very different approaches to arrive at their answers, will result in stronger predictions than ensembling two decision trees with similar parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other side, if the models you ensemble are very similar in how they make predictions, you'll get a negligible boost from ensembling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensembling models with very different accuracies will not generally improve your accuracy. Ensembling a model with a .75 AUC and a model with a .85 AUC on a test set will usually result in an AUC somewhere in between the two original values. There's a way around this which we'll discuss later on, called weighting."
