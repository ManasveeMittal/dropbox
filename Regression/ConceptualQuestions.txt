Q1. Which of the following step / assumption in regression modeling impacts the trade-off between under-fitting and over-fitting the most.

A. The polynomial degree

B. Whether we learn the weights by matrix inversion or gradient descent

C. The use of a constant-term

Solution: A

Choosing the right degree of polynomial plays a critical role in fit of regression. If we choose higher degree of polynomial, chances of overfit increase significantly.
