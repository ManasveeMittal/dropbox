Configure pgAdmin->Paths->Binary paths and set "PostgreSQL Binary Path" as shown in the screenshot. Depending on your OS and installation details, the binaries may be located elsewhere. Try

`which psql`
from the command line on linux/Unix systems.

A Windows example: PostgreSQL Binary Path: "C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\9.6\bin"
