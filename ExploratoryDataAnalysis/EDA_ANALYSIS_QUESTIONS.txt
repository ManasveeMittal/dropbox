EDA ANALYSIS QUESTIONS
	What is a typical value?
		Measures of Location
	What is the uncertainty for a typical value?
		characterize the spread, or variability, of a data set
	What is a good distributional fit for a set of numbers?
		Probability Plot Correlation Coefficient Plot 
			http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/section3/ppccplot.htm
			Questions:
				What is the best-fit member within a distributional family?
				Does the best-fit member provide a good fit (in terms of generating a probability plot with a high correlation coefficient)?
				Does this distributional family provide a good fit compared to other distributions?
How sensitive is the choice of the shape parameter?
	What is a percentile?
		http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/prc/section2/prc252.htm
	Does an engineering modification have an effect?
		Bihistogram:
			http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/section3/bihistog.htm
			Purpose: 
				Check for a change in location, variation, or distribution
			Questions:
				Is a (2-level) factor significant?
				Does a (2-level) factor have an effect?
				Does the location change between the 2 subgroups?
				Does the variation change between the 2 subgroups?
				Does the distributional shape change between subgroups?
				Are there any outliers?
	Does a factor have an effect?
		Block Plots
			http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/section3/blockplo.htm
			Purpose: 
				Check to determine if a factor of interest has an effect robust over all other factors
			Questions:
				Is the factor of interest significant?
				Does the factor of interest have an effect?
				Does the location change between levels of the primary factor?
				Has the process improved?
				What is the best setting (= level) of the primary factor?
				How much of an average improvement can we expect with this best setting of the primary factor?
				Is there an interaction between the primary factor and one or more nuisance factors?
				Does the effect of the primary factor change depending on the setting of some nuisance factor?
				Are there any outliers?

			Related Techniques:
				t test (for shift in location for exactly 2 levels) 
				ANOVA (for shift in location for 2 or more levels) 
				Bihistogram (for shift in location, variation, and distribution for exactly 2 levels).

	What are the most important factors?
		DOE Mean Plot
			http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/section3/dexmeanp.htm
		Purpose:
			Detect Important Factors With Respect to Location
		Questions:
			Which factors are important? The DOE mean plot does not provide a definitive answer to this question, but it does help categorize factors as "clearly important", "clearly not important", and "borderline importance".
			What is the ranking list of the important factors?
		Related Techniques
			DOE scatter plot
			DOE standard deviation plot
			Block plot
			Box plot
			Analysis of variance
	Are measurements coming from different laboratories equivalent?
		Youden Plot:
			http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/section3/youdplot.htm
		Purpose:
			effective method for comparing both the within-laboratory variability and the between-laboratory variability
		Questions:
			Are all labs equivalent?
			What labs have between-lab problems (reproducibility)?
			What labs have within-lab problems (repeatability)?
			What labs are outliers?

		Related Techniques
			Scatter Plot

	What is the best function for relating a response variable to a set of factor variables?
		Nonlinear Least Squares Regression
			http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/pmd/section1/pmd142.htm

	Can we separate signal from noise in time dependent data?
			SPECTRAL PLOT
				http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/section3/spectrum.htm

	Can we extract any structure from multivariate data?
		Star Plot
			http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/section3/starplot.htm
			Questions
			The star plot can be used to answer the following Questions:
				What variables are dominant for a given observation?
				Which observations are most similar, i.e., are there clusters of observations?
				Are there outliers?
	Does the data have outliers?
		Box Plot
			Purpose: 
				Check location and variation shifts
			Questions:
				Is a factor significant?
				Does the location differ between subgroups?
				Does the variation differ between subgroups?
				Are there any outliers?
			Related Techniques:
				Mean Plot
				Analysis of Variance



PRIMARY GOAL OF EDA:
	a good-fitting, parsimonious model
	a list of outliers
	a sense of robustness of conclusions
	estimates for parameters
	uncertainties for those estimates
	a ranked list of important factors
	conclusions as to whether individual factors are statistically significant
	optimal settings


	Typical value
		Measures of Location
